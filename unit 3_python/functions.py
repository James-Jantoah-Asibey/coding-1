# what is a function?

# A function is a se of instructions that will perform a 
# specific task.

# there are two variations of functions: user-defined function
# and built-in functions.

# Built-in functions: instructions that have already been written,
#are built-in to the programming language.

print('coding class') # print is built-in function. We can identify  
# by the round brackets

name= input('what is your name')
number= int(input('please type in number'))

print(name)
print(3*number)

# all data types, variables and operators are just places for us 
# to use order to write instructions for functions.

#user defined funtions - custom functions created by an engineer.

# how do you write a user defined funtion?

def pbAndj():
    print(' step 1. grab two slices of bread')
    print(' step 2. spread penut butter on one side of bread')
    print(' step 3. spread jelly on the other side of bread')
    print(' step 4. put sandwich together with spread/')



    # functions 11/20/24

    # function definition= tells the computer
    # our instructions and stores it for later
    # untl its called
def performMath(x):
       print('data has benn recieved.')
       print('about to preform multiplication')
       print(300*x)
       print('task complete')
       print('this function will now do addition')
       print(26+x)

# function call- when we write the funtions
# name, the computer will runour
# instructions
performMath(2) # the number inside
#the round bracket is the data
# we want our functions to work on.
performMath(14)
# we want our function to work on.
# performMath(14)
# performMath(28)

def depositMoney():
# int() is a built in function
# that allows us to transformstrings into numbers.
# we pass in the data we want to transform into the 
# round bracket
    depositAmount= int (input('please enter the amount you want to deposit'))
    checkingAccount= 2000
    ('desposit put into account sucessfully.')
    print(depositamount + checkingAccount)

# depositMonye()

# just like in a resturant, kitchen has the function
# definition, but will only make the food 
# when its called
