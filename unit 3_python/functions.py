# what is a function?

# A function is a se of instructions that will perform a 
# specific task.

# there are two variations of functions: user-defined function
# and built-in functions.

# Built-in functions: instructions that have already been written,
#are built-in to the programming language.

print('coding class') # print is built-in function. We can identify  
# by the round brackets

name= input('what is your name')
number= int(input('please type in number'))

print(name)
print(3*number)

# all data types, variables and operators are just places for us 
# to use order to write instructions for functions.

#user defined funtions - custom functions created by an engineer.

# how do you write a user defined funtion?
